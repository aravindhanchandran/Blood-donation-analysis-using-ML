# Blood-donation-analysis-using-ML

Aim Of Project: 

To build a model which can identify who is likely to donate blood again. 

Machine learning model used in this project are

   1.Logistic Regression
   
   2.Naive Bayes
   
   3.Support Vector Machine
  
   4.Decision Tree
   
   5.Random Forest
   

Using different Machine Learning model to conclude which models predict highest accuracy score

Out of 5 models Support Vector Machine predict the accuracy of 78%
